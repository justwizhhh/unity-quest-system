# Unity Quest System (ARCHIVE)

A dynamic quest system coded in Unity, themed after bounties in a hypothetical adventure game. Includes a bounty board menu for choosing quests, multiple quest conditions/rewards, ScriptableObjects for custom types of quests, and debug features for level designers to add/remove quests. 

Made in ~2 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "Game Engine Programming' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology), in conjunction with an Unreal Engine 5 version which can be found here: https://github.com/justwizhhh/unreal5-quest-system
